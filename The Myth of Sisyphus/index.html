<p><strong>Halcyon</strong>, a mythical bird that has the power to calm the ocean, female</p>
<p>(A steep hill near the city of Athens. A morning in the winter solstice in ancient time. A halcyon bird, on its way to breed in the ocean, finds out that a strange man is pushing a humongous boulder to the mountain top. The boulder automictically rolls down. The man walks back and pushes the boulder again. The halcyon is curious and fly by the man, asking him questions.)</p>

<h1 id="Play"><a href="#Play" class="headerlink" title="Play"></a>Play</h1><p><em>Halcyon</em></p>
<p>(hovering near Sisyphus, effortlessly)</p>
<p>What a bizarre job you are doing! Why do you keep pushing the large stone? </p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(pushing the boulder up in the hill, noticing the halcyon)</p>
<p>Good morning, traveler. I can tell that you come from afar and I wish a prosperous winter. I have noticed your curiosity about my job. But it is nothing but merely a daily chore assigned to me, by Hades.</p>
<p><em>HALCYON</em></p>
<p>(pondering on Sisyphus’ response)</p>
<p>Hades, you mean the stingy god who rules the underworld? I have come across him several times in my travels. He does seem like the kind of god who takes umbrage on petty things. What is it you did that crossed him?</p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(still in the process of rolling the stone up)</p>
<p>Hades is not the only god I angered. Maybe the whole Olympians want to see me like this.</p>
<p><em>HLACYON</em></p>
<p>(surprised with disbelief)</p>
<p>All the Olympians? I find it hard to believe. Did you steal the most precious ambrosia from the Goddesses? Did you have a fling with one of Zeus’ wives? Or did you slaughter a whole city? </p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(amused by the remarks, pushing the boulder near the mountain top)</p>
<p>It is really none of that. I simply pulled a small trick on Thanatos, the God of death. But Hades and Zeus considered it a cardinal crime. Maybe because they don’t fancy the idea that a mortal human is outsmarting a god.</p>
<p><em>HALCYON</em></p>
<p>A small trick?</p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(stopping the boulder near the mountain top, watching the boulder rolling down itself)</p>
<p>Yes. I just tricked Thanatos into chaining himself, so that people in my city no longer needed to die. It took a while for the Gods to realize the chaining when they were annoyed that there were no more human sacrifices. </p>
<p><em>HALCYON</em></p>
<p>On my heavens! You are the person who cheated death! But I am surprised that Zeus did not kill you but granted you the immortal life. So when do you stop working today? I want to take you to my nest and show you something.</p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(standing on the top of the mountain) </p>
<p>You see, my friends. The gods made me immortal because they thought it is best way to punish me. Because I will be forever pushing this stone to the mountain top, watching it rolling down, and pushing it again. I am sorry that I cannot accept your invitation, because I do not have any day off. The job is everything, till eternity. </p>
<p><em>HALCYON</em></p>
<p>This is just absurd! How can someone be punished like this? Those Gods are just indeed petty and mean-spirited! I felt bad for you.</p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(walking down to the mountain, putting his hands on the boulder)</p>
<p>I thank you for your condolence. But don’t be. I will admit that at first, I did consider it one of the worst kind of punishment. But once I realized that it was something I will have to do forever, my mind has changed. The punishment will only be painful if I choose to accept it, surrendering to the will of the Gods. Maybe I was bound to perform this task physically, but my soul is still under my own control. I realized that this is no longer a punishment if I choose not to see it as a punishment, thereby defying the Gods, again. Such a renewed mindset granted me a serene satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>HALCYON</em></p>
<p>(looking confused)</p>
<p>Forgive me that I may not understand your sentiment, for I have always felt free to fly wherever I want. Repeating a simple task till eternity, your punishment looks cruel and absurd. But I am happy to see that you seem to find a way to make peace with your punishment. Maybe like you said, once you realized you are still in control of your mind, this is no longer a punishment. I wish you best. Now I must go, I hope to see you in the years ahead.</p>
<p><em>SISYPHUS</em></p>
<p>(patting the boulder)</p>
<p>Thank you for your blessing. My best wishes to you as well.</p>
<p>(The HALCYON fly away, leaving Sisyphus and the boulder alone) </p>
